Once you are logged it, CDS Business Health will have access to all data.




///////////// Additional Information ////////////////

(Topic referenced) - There is a lack of connection to the quickbooks API due to the fact the quickbooks api only allow Oauth2 ajax requests
from server side applications. Until we know Node.js, the functionality will be cut. 

THERE ARE PLANS FOR FUTURE CHANGES. Stay tuned.
